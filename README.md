Learning hacking? It can seem daunting, where do I start? what topics?, books? resources?

I created this script to randomly pic a subject based on your selected topic. 

Once a topic has been selected it will set a 30 minute timer.

You can place a .bat file on your desktop to launch this script when you start your study time.

If you want to add a topic or subject let me know! Hope you enjoy it ;-)
