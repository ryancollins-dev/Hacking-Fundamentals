## Learning hacking? 

It can seem daunting at first right, where do I start? what topics?, books? resources?

I created this script to randomly pic a subject based on your selected topic. 

Once a topic has been selected it will set a 30 minute timer for your studies.

You can place a .bat file on your desktop to launch this script when your study time begins.

If you want to add a topic or subject please let me know! Hope you enjoy it ;-)

Each list contains content from https://www.pentesteracademy.com/ and various other resources.

I recommend installing [Kali linux](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/) in a virtual machine, you can use [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/ca/products/workstation-pro.html).

In addition to these study topics, I recommend you practice some CTF's, and you can find a good list [here.](https://github.com/ryancollins-dev/tips-n-tricks/tree/main/Wargames)
